Below are the assumptions taken into consideration for the design of the attached ER diagram:

1. Due to the m:n relationship between Student, Project and Coding Class, I have created a new bridge entity called ENROLL, wherein the assumption is that each
Student needs to be a part of both coding class and a project. 

2. ROOM_NUM attribute acting as the foreign key in CODING_CLASS and PROJECT entity helps the student to understand where the class/project will be held and the attributes: PROJECT_TIME AND CLASS_TIME
help in informing the student the time slot for the same. 

3. The attribute MITOCONTROL_TYPE is an enum with values given in the question. Also, the attribute CODING_LANG is an enum with the programming languages specified in the question. 

4. In order to make sure each project has only 4 students, where in there is restriction placed on the attribute: NUM_OF_STUDENTS to make sure only 4 students are a part of a group. 

5. Vendors and suppliers both independently supply the project parts for an order. 

6. An instructor is both required to supervise a project and teach a coding class. 

7. Project has a project parts and every part is uniquely identified by a part ID. Different set of project parts are combined and allocated to different projects. Every project group based on 
the type of the project( based on this value: MITOCONTROL_TYPE) has different project parts which is hence placed in a storage box in a designated table. Every different project has different set of project parts that are furnished by orders placed to suppliers and vendors. 

8. Each class has a class name wherein it specifies the coding language taught in that class and hence each student rates a coding class, instructor and a project. The value score is which specifies the rating given by each student and the value score has restrictions placed in order to score from 1-5 stars only. 

9. The num of books borrowed from the library are restricted to 4 by placing restrictions
On the attribute.
